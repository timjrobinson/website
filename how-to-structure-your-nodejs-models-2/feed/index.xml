What I think he means is that the user class should not have a method for getting a list of all users. A method that would return &quot;IDs of all users this user is related to (somehow)&quot; makes sense though. There could be a users class with user as a sub-class though.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You say that &quot;But you donâ€™t want the method for fetching users to be part of each user because that doesnâ€™t make any sense&quot;, however it seems to me that it is still part of every user object? or am i missing something?


Thanks for the article, im new to nodejs and this defs helped to get me going with my models :)]]></description>

I&#039;m new on nodejs, not js. This article seems to me good. About your question: look for mongoose. []&#039;s

After a better search I think you alright: http://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#model-js]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was with you until I saw the stringify. Do you mean you are storing the whole user profile as JSON in one database cell? Can you effectively search for individual values later? I&#039;m not using JS on the server side yet, so this looked odd to me.]]></description>
