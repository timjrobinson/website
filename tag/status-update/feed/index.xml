										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I unfortunately procrastinated the March status update so much that it has melded into the April update. Over the past 2 months I&#8217;ve been working on 4 of my <a href="/one-project-every-month/">10 Projects for 2017</a>. Those 4 are: Paper Towers, Spanish, Krav Maga, and learning the Cello. My current core focus is learning the Cello and I&#8217;m spending 3 &#8211; 4 hours a week on the rest.</p>
<h4>Paper Towers (Now Tower Storm again)</h4>
<p>Firstly I decided to stick with the name Tower Storm instead of re-branding this project as Paper Towers. I&#8217;m proud to say that <a href="http://github.com/towerstorm/game">Tower Storm is finally Open Source!</a>. I spent around 30 hours in the last 2 months removing all copyrighted graphics and sounds from the game, and cleaning up the code so it&#8217;s easy for anyone to run and make modifications. I finally pulled the trigger a few hours ago and put it up on Github. I also did <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/139235975">my first open source development stream</a>, if you&#8217;re interested in seeing how I develop Tower Storm, how to mod it yourself, and my thoughts on programming in general you can follow me on Twitch.</p>
<h4>Spanish</h4>
<p>As of the 21st of April I was up to a 25 day streak on Duolingo doing at least 30 minutes of spanish a day (50xp per day). Unfortunately I lost that streak, but I will be continually learning Spanish on Duolingo over the next year. Alongside that I&#8217;ve been watching movies, LoL games and random Youtube videos in Spanish. I&#8217;ve also switched my PC and Phone to use Spanish as their default language. Every little bit of learning helps.</p>
<h4>Krav Maga</h4>
<p>I signed up for Krav Maga 2 weeks ago and so far have done 6 classes. I&#8217;ll probably continue this 3 times a week schedule. So far we&#8217;ve practiced basic punching, hammer fist, kicking, roundhouse kicks, getting out of chokes, and defending yourself when you&#8217;re on the ground. I&#8217;m really enjoying it so far, it&#8217;s useful, it&#8217;s a ton of fun fighting as hard as you can (into pads) and it&#8217;s a great workout. I hadn&#8217;t been punched in maybe 15 years and it&#8217;s an eye opening experience, and made me realize I have to toughen up a lot if I want to survive a real life fight.</p>
<h4>Cello</h4>
<p>To celebrate the open sourcing of Tower Storm and the down-winding of that project I went out and hired a Cello for 3 months. I&#8217;ve only had it a week now and haven&#8217;t had lessons yet. I bought a beginners book and have been teaching myself how to play with that and YouTube tutorials. I&#8217;m excited to report that I can already play the beginning of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mcdMrZMKhc">Rains Of Castamere</a> song! Albeit with a lot of squeaks and quite slowly. I can&#8217;t wait to learn more.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s it. I&#8217;ll be continuing to focus on these 4 activities until at least the end of May whereupon I may start on another depending on my progress and time available.</p>
