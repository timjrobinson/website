										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A short post for those in Internet Marketing who still believe the &#8220;Put everything above the fold because people don&#8217;t usually scroll down&#8221; myth. Unfortunately whoever originally said this didn&#8217;t quite think the data through and it has been repeated ad-nausium by Internet Marketers ever since.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s why you shouldn&#8217;t worry about putting your stuff above the fold and it may even be counterproductive to jam it all up there:</p>
<ol>
<li>Most people aren&#8217;t interested in what you&#8217;re selling. Especially if your traffic isn&#8217;t pre-sold or coming from relevant locations. Not all traffic is equal and I really wish people would stop a/b testing like it is. </li>
<li>60% of people don&#8217;t scroll down because they don&#8217;t like what you have to sell, not because they don&#8217;t know how to scroll. </li>
<li>Putting your signup form above the fold is counterproductive. Just because people don&#8217;t scroll dosn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;re going to be like &#8220;Oh wow a signup form, I better add my details&#8221;. </li>
<li>If you had better content or marketing in place of that signup form you&#8217;ll probably (test this!) get better results as you hook people in and get them to register later. </li>
</ol>
<p>The core thing you should be putting above the fold is content that sucks your visitors in, something that within 5 seconds makes them think &#8220;Hey this is a problem I have and they may have the solution&#8221;.</p>
<p>Here are things that should not be above the fold:</p>
<ol>
<li>Videos that start slowly (boring)</li>
<li>Signup forms (seriously the only person who would sign up without reading is your Mum, or heavily presold visitors, in which case it doesn&#8217;t matter where your signup form is). </li>
<li>Pictures that mean nothing to fresh visitors (your logo, stock photography, banners etc). </li>
<li>Links (If you want your visitors to do something don&#8217;t overload them with options). </li>
</ol>
<p>Now go build a landing page people actually enjoy and remember: test everything. If you think I&#8217;m wrong run a test then come back here and tell me how wrong I am. Being told I&#8217;m wrong is fantastic, because it helps me constantly grow and be a better market and human being.</p>
