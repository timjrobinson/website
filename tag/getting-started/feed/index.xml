										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few months ago my web host was hacked and the villains that broke in began using it to send spam email. I didn&#8217;t even notice until I began getting auto-replies from people I&#8217;ve never emailed quoting the spam messages my server was sending.</p>
<p>Now trying to track down a break in and find any backdoors installed on your server is a painful experience when running just one site. This server was running over 50 sites.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m trying to cut my life to the bare minimum in all areas and <a href="http://sivers.org/hellyeah">saying no</a> to everything that isn&#8217;t exactly what I want to do. Soon after this hack took place I realized I haden&#8217;t cleaned up my online life. Back when I was doing Internet Marketing full time I purchased hundreds of domains with full intentions of turning them into niche sites each making a few dollars a day so I could achieve completely passive income (the dream.. right?). Unfortunately as what happens to most people that travel down this route it didn&#8217;t go quite as planned and 3 years later I&#8217;m left with hundreds of domains not pulling in much traffic and costing a boatload of money to maintain.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s little use in keeping these old sites around when they&#8217;re simply being money sinks and the rest of my life has moved onto bigger and better things. Even though I haven&#8217;t looked at them in years they still give mental and financial baggage when I&#8217;m doing tasks such as backing up my sites, switching hosts or navigating cpanel.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ve gone ahead and deleted them all. I&#8217;m down to about 30 domains most if not all related to <a href="http://www.zentester.com/">ZenTester</a> and <a href="http://www.towerstorm.com/">Tower Storm</a>. If I don&#8217;t begin working or selling these remaining domains in the next 6 months I&#8217;ll be unregistering them too.</p>
<p>After this great purge I discovered there&#8217;s only one domain on this web host that I wanted to keep running, this very blog you&#8217;re reading now.</p>
<p>Being that I&#8217;m moving web hosts anyway I thought why not upgrade my blog to advance with my programming career. I made the switch from PHP to NodeJS coding over 2 years ago now so if I want a blog I can hack on without wanting to tear my hair out (ok WordPress isn&#8217;t that bad, but I am sick of PHP) I might as well use Ghost.</p>
<p>So here I am, typing in Ghost. It&#8217;s kind of nice, in an elegant zen kind of way. It doesn&#8217;t have the features of WordPress, but it doesn&#8217;t have the bloat either, and so far it&#8217;s going ok.</p>
