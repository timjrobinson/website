What I think he means is that the user class should not have a method for getting a list of all users. A method that would return &quot;IDs of all users this user is related to (somehow)&quot; makes sense though. There could be a users class with user as a sub-class though.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You say that &quot;But you donâ€™t want the method for fetching users to be part of each user because that doesnâ€™t make any sense&quot;, however it seems to me that it is still part of every user object? or am i missing something?


Thanks for the article, im new to nodejs and this defs helped to get me going with my models :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was with you until I saw the stringify. Do you mean you are storing the whole user profile as JSON in one database cell? Can you effectively search for individual values later? I&#039;m not using JS on the server side yet, so this looked odd to me.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just stumbled onto this and I have to disagree with this implementation completely.
What is happening here is that the unit test is relying on something which exists outside of the unit&#039;s world which is something that you should never care about. Instead of the unit test using the actual moment implementation you should stub getCurrentTime and return what you want in order to unit test this. This way you can test various scenarios which could be time sensitive.]]></description>
